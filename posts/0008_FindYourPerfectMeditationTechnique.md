"We all have unique brains with unique cognitive fingerprints, and the biggest mistake that we make in teaching meditation is that we try to use one technique for all of the different brains," says Dr. K. That's why exploring a variety of meditation styles, whether it's energizing techniques like Tumo or calming methods like alternate-nostril breathing, can make a world of difference for each individual. Michael, a fictitious sales manager, discovered that focusing on breathwork helped him ease his racing thoughts and find the self-confidence he’d always felt was missing. By experimenting with guided visualizations, short mindfulness sessions, and lively group practices, he uncovered a deeper sense of motivation and empathy, both at work and at home. These practices are about slowly tuning into your own mental and physical needs rather than forcing yourself into a one-size-fits-all routine. When the mind is agitated, a grounding strategy like slow breathing exercises can soothe the nervous system and pave the way for better focus. If feeling drained or sluggish, tapping into energizing rituals like Tumo can stoke inner passion and spark fresh creativity. Just as each person’s morning playlist might differ, our meditation approaches should reflect our personal preferences and goals. How might you discover your own perfect meditation match today?
