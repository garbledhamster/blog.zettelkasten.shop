Title: What Is Visual Thinking and How to Use It with Zettelkasten
Description: A Zettelkasten is about making connections, but sometimes pure text isn’t enough to capture the relationships between ideas. Visual thinking—using simple sketches, diagrams, and spatial arrangements—can bring clarity where words fall short. Dan Roam’s The Back of the Napkin lays out a process for breaking down problems into who, what, where, when, how, and why, a structure that aligns perfectly with organizing knowledge.

A Zettelkasten is about making connections, but sometimes pure text isn’t enough to capture the relationships between ideas. Visual thinking—using simple sketches, diagrams, and spatial arrangements—can bring clarity where words fall short. Dan Roam’s The Back of the Napkin lays out a process for breaking down problems into **who, what, where, when, how, and why**, a structure that aligns perfectly with organizing knowledge.

Instead of relying solely on written notes, try **sketching key concepts, mapping out arguments, and drawing relationships between ideas**. The **SQVID framework** helps shift perspectives, balancing simplicity with depth and vision with execution. Whether you’re illustrating a workflow, summarizing a book, or capturing a fleeting thought, **a quick drawing in your Zettelkasten can make abstract ideas concrete and easier to retrieve later**. Grab a pen, start sketching, and let your ideas unfold visually.
