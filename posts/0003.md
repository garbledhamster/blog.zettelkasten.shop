**Goal setting** is a powerful skill that shapes every ambition, from mastering new reading material to advancing career and fitness objectives. By defining your targets—whether you need essential background knowledge or you’re diving deep into a complex subject—you can choose the most effective approach and manage your time so that mental fatigue never gains the upper hand. Plan your study sessions in focused intervals (25 minutes on, 5 minutes off; 60 minutes on, 15 minutes off) and start with the most challenging tasks first, building momentum for everything that follows. Keep track of your daily progress by jotting down quick objectives in your Zettelkasten, noting milestones and refining goals as you learn. As an exercise, identify your single most important reading target each day—something you’ve been postponing—and tackle that first; then break your study time into intervals to keep your mind fresh and fully engaged. This combination of prioritizing big tasks and breaking up effort into short, intense sprints keeps you focused, energized, and on a clear path to growth and accomplishment.
