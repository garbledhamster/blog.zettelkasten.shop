# Embracing the Unfamiliar: How to Read Difficult Books

> "In tackling a difficult book for the first time, read it through without ever stopping to look up or ponder the things you do not understand right away. Pay attention to what you can understand and do not be stopped by what you cannot immediately grasp."

Reading is one of my favorite ways to engage with the world, but not all books are equal in their accessibility. Some texts are dense, laden with jargon, or packed with complex ideas that can feel overwhelming. Mortimer J. Adler, in his insightful book on reading comprehension, encourages us to approach these challenging works with an open mind: “In tackling a difficult book for the first time, read it through without ever stopping to look up or ponder the things you do not understand right away.” This is a mantra I have adopted and it has changed my relationship with reading.

The initial temptation when faced with a dense book is to stop at every unfamiliar term or concept, to backtrack and try to unravel the knot of confusion before moving on. But this often leads to frustration and a fragmented reading experience. Instead, Adler suggests that we focus on what we *can* understand and allow ourselves to move through the text. This approach invites exploration rather than paralysis.

When I tackle a challenging book, I dive in with a sense of curiosity. I read it in its entirety, even if I stumble over certain passages. I let the words wash over me, absorbing the tone, the rhythm, and the broader messages. Often, the context will illuminate meanings that might not be immediately clear. By the time I reach the end, I have a holistic sense of the book that I can then unpack in more depth.

What happens next is crucial. After reading, I take a moment to reflect on what I've absorbed. I often find that questions bubble up—questions that the book sparked but didn’t fully answer. This is where my library comes into play. I’ve built a collection of books that I’ve read, and I can lean into these resources to help clarify and expand on the concepts I encountered.

I have a process that I follow after finishing a book. First, I pick a question that seems to emerge from my reading. It could be something like, “What does the author mean by this concept?” or “How does this relate to my understanding of a broader topic?” Once I hone in on my question, I refer to my Zettelkasten notes and overview cards that I’ve compiled over time. The Zettelkasten method has transformed the way I interact with ideas, allowing me to connect thoughts and insights across various texts.

With that question fresh in my mind, I select another book from my library that I believe will help answer it. I prime myself for the next dive by reviewing my notes, reminding myself of key concepts and insights I’ve previously encountered. This sets the stage for a focused reading session where I'm not just passively consuming information; I'm actively seeking to integrate new knowledge with what I already understand.

I enter a hyper-focused state, ready to get nuts with the text. This is where the magic happens. As I read, I often find that the previous challenging text suddenly makes more sense, and I can see how the ideas connect. The questions I had become the threads that weave together a richer tapestry of understanding. 

In this way, I’ve learned that reading is not just a solitary act but a conversation across texts. Each book is a piece of a larger puzzle, and when I approach them with intention—first by absorbing the unfamiliar and then by exploring my questions—I find that my understanding deepens exponentially. 

So, the next time you sit down with a difficult book, remember to embrace the struggle. Read through it without stopping to get bogged down. Pay attention to what resonates, and let the rest simmer in the background. Then, turn to your library and your notes to explore those lingering questions. This process transforms reading from a chore into a journey of discovery, where each book enriches your understanding and inspires new avenues of thought. 

Happy reading!
