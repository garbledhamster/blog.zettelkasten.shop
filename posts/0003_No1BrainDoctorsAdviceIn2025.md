# No. 1 Brain Doctor's Advice in 2025

Dr. Daniel Amen, a renowned psychiatrist who has scanned over 260,000 brains, reveals how everyday habits can either fortify or shrink our cognitive power. He warns that excessive alcohol, marijuana, head impacts in sports, “doom-scrolling” on social media, and even high-sugar diets may accelerate “brain rot”—a term reflecting our concerns about diminishing brain health. His studies underscore how negative thinking, chemical-laden foods, and overstimulation from gaming or pornography can deaden vital brain regions, impairing memory, mood, and motivation. Thankfully, Dr. Amen also emphasizes that our brains can heal: swapping toxic habits for exercise, coordination sports, quality sleep, mindful breathing, and nourishing nutrients (like saffron and omega-3s) helps restore balance. By aiming for “brain envy”—a proactive desire to protect and nurture our minds—we can boost resilience, sharpen focus, and safeguard our emotional well-being, regardless of age or past choices.
