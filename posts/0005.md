> “Skimming or pre-reading is the first stage of inspectional reading. Your aim is to discover whether the book requires a more careful reading and to learn everything that the surface alone can teach you.”

**Inspectional Skimming** is a rapid reading technique designed to extract a book’s **overall structure and theme** before committing to deeper study. It’s a skill that separates passive readers from active learners. Instead of diving straight into the first page, first scan the **title, table of contents, preface, and index**—this gives a roadmap of the book’s core ideas. Next, flip through **chapter headings, subheadings, and bolded or italicized phrases**, picking up on patterns and recurring themes. Finally, read the **introduction and conclusion** of key chapters to get a sense of the author’s argument. This technique allows you to quickly assess whether a book is worth a full read, helps you locate the most relevant sections, and prevents getting bogged down in unnecessary details. **Daily Practice**: Pick a non-fiction book and spend **10 minutes skimming** using these steps—then write a short paragraph summarizing what you think the book is about. Compare your initial impressions with a deeper read later.
