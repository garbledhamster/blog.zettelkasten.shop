Many people mistake reading widely for reading well, but as Mortimer Adler warns, "There have always been literate ignoramuses who have read too widely and not well." Skimming through countless books without truly engaging with them creates only the illusion of knowledge. Proper reading requires depth, where the reader actively dissects a book’s arguments, rather than passively absorbing information. Adler outlines four levels of reading—elementary, inspectional, analytical, and syntopical—each requiring increasing intellectual effort. The key is to "come to terms" with the author, understanding their words as they intended, rather than imposing one’s own assumptions. Reading well means questioning, reflecting, and connecting ideas across books to build genuine understanding. Without this, one risks becoming what the Greeks called a sophomore—someone with the arrogance of knowledge but not its substance. Instead of chasing book counts, focus on wrestling with ideas until they shape your thinking. True mastery comes not from how much you read, but from how well you read.
