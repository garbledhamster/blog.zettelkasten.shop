> “In tackling a difficult book for the first time, read it through without ever stopping to look up or ponder the things you do not understand right away.”

**Surface Reading** is a counterintuitive yet powerful approach to tackling complex texts. Instead of getting stuck on every difficult word or concept, read straight through without pausing—your goal is **maximum exposure, not immediate mastery**. This technique prevents frustration and allows you to grasp the **big picture** before diving into details. Think of it as laying the foundation of a house before installing the finer details. When you revisit the book for deeper study, your familiarity will make comprehension **far easier**. **Daily Practice**: Pick a challenging book and read **10 pages without stopping**, even when encountering difficult ideas. Focus on **what you do understand**, and let that serve as your anchor for later, deeper reading. Over time, your mind will naturally begin to **connect the dots**, strengthening comprehension with less effort.
