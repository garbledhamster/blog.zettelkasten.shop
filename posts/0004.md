> “Skimming or pre-reading is the first stage of inspectional reading. Your aim is to discover whether the book requires a more careful reading and to learn everything that the surface alone can teach you.”

**Pre-reading summaries** act as a quick map before you invest time in a full journey—by skimming contents, reading introductions, and capturing key points in a short paragraph, you gain immediate clarity on a book’s purpose. This fast snapshot helps you decide how deeply to read, whether for a broad overview or for deeper, careful study. As a busy student, professional, or lifelong learner, you save time by targeting the sections most relevant to your goals: are you seeking background knowledge, or do you need granular details for a research project? Write these initial impressions in your Zettelkasten, noting any expectations or initial questions. Once you read further, revise your summary, sharpening your roadmap. Together with purposeful breaks (like the 25/5 or 60/15 approach), these previews keep your mind focused, protect you from aimless wandering through text, and ensure you’ll truly profit from every reading adventure.
