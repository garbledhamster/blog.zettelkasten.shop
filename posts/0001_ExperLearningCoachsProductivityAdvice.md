> Stop trusting your brain to magically stay on track—productivity is about purposeful action, not constant busyness. Start small to build momentum, then go “nuclear” on persistent obstacles by removing them entirely when necessary. Keep your system streamlined to reduce friction, and nurture deep flow by identifying and eliminating distractions. Plan for reality, not the ideal: track how long tasks actually take, block realistic times, and protect those blocks from interruptions. Distinguish urgent tasks from important ones, and practice “or not and” to consciously trade off lower priorities for truly impactful goals. Use quick hits like the two-minute rule, schedule tasks early to avoid delays, and batch small chores together to maintain focus. Above all, sharpen the ax—invest in learning and refining your methods so you can consistently accomplish more with less effort.
