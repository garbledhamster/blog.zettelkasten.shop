**Word recognition** is the foundation of literacy—without it, reading comprehension cannot develop. It is the ability to instantly and accurately identify words, whether through phonetic decoding or sight recognition. Skilled readers don’t just sound out words; they recognize them automatically, freeing cognitive resources for comprehension. To build this skill, practice **phonics** (connecting letters to sounds), **sight words** (memorizing high-frequency words), and **context clues** (inferring meaning from surrounding words). A daily exercise: read a passage **slowly**, underline unfamiliar words, and break them down by syllables and roots. Over time, your brain internalizes word patterns, making reading effortless and fluid. Master **word recognition**, and you unlock the gateway to higher levels of reading.
